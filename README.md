# LD34

My Project created for Lundum Dare 34 in Dec 2015. Themes were: "two button game, growing". 

It's a small Game called FlowerPower based on old handheld lcd games with only two buttons. You can collect falling drops with flower head. Points are based on timeplayed and collected drops. When your lives run out, game is over. Have Fun!

Used Software:
  * Unity 3D
  * GIMP 2
  * VisualStudio 2015
